  help: |
    Specifies the path to a file containing identifying information for the
    authority with which actions should be taken (can be overridden via the
    '--auth-file' flag).

- name: noop
  private: true
  help: |
    (for development) Prevents the CLI from having any side effects. Use this
    in your tests to prevent things like outbound API calls and I/O operations
    from being made, and use this in your implementation to gate such things.

flags:
- long: --quiet
  short: -q
  help: |
    Displays less and possibly no output. Has no effect if '--json' is also
    specified

  help: |
    Displays all STDOUT output as JSON (messages to STDERR will still print
    as normal, but also be included in the final JSON report)

- long: --interactive
  help: |
    Tips the CLI out of its default hands-free, fire-and-forget, non-
    interactive mode (which is useful for CI integrations and scripting) to
    one better-suited to human usage.

- long: --noop

    Prevents the CLI from having any side effects.
